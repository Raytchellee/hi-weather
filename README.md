## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: Utilized for building fast and scalable React applications. Next.js provides server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and routing out of the box.
- **Recoil**: Employed for managing application state in React components. Recoil offers a simple and efficient way to handle complex state requirements.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Used as the runtime environment for server-side JavaScript code execution. Node.js enables building scalable and high-performance backend applications.
- **Express.js**: Employed as the web application framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: Chosen as the NoSQL database solution for its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB allows for storing and querying structured and unstructured data efficiently.
- **PostgreSQL**: Utilized as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for structured data storage. PostgreSQL offers ACID compliance and supports complex queries and transactions.

### Deployment
- **Integration with Weather Data APIs**: Integrated with weather data APIs such as OpenWeatherMap to fetch real-time weather information. This integration enhances the application's functionality by providing accurate weather forecasts and data.
